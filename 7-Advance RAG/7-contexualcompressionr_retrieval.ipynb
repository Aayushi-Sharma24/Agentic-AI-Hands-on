He highlights that democracy and freedom are under attack, referencing events such as the January 6 insurrection as the gravest threat to U.S. democracy since the Civil War. Biden insists on speaking the truth and burying lies about these events, stating that political violence has no place in America. He calls on all, regardless of party, to join together to defend democracy, respect free and fair elections, restore trust in institutions, and remember their oath of office. Biden stresses that defending democracy is crucial for the future, where freedoms are protected and opportunities made fairer for all.'}"
